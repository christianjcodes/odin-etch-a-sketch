TOP Project 4 - Etch A Sketch

INITIAL THOUGHTS:

Alright, fourth project here we go! I'm excited about this one, but also a little nervous. The lesson stressed that this one won't be easy, so I'm preparing myself mentally for the challenge. 

Because they're saying it won't be easy, I want to definitely avoid looking at solutions and try my best to problem-solve on my own, which I'm getting better at with each thing I work on. If I look for help, I'd like to go to TOP's discord or Stack Overflow, etc. I haven't asked questions yet and I think that's something I should get used to, since it's a big part of programming.

Anyway, that's it for my inital thoughts, let's get this thing going!


UPDATE 1/1/2025:

I finally came back and finished this project. Back when I had initially started it, it proved too challenging for me at the time. I went on to take other courses and learn more about programming, with this project always in the back of my mind to come back and conquer. 

Well, today was that day. I sat down and finished it out, and it functions as required by the assignment. Super proud of the progress I've made in the years since starting this project!
